## Git and GitHub

That's all new for me. I never used git before, but it's seems very useful. I learned how to use terminal (basic commands like git log, git clone, git push etc.), how to find bugs in previous version, how to work with repository and more importent - how to collaborate with team throught GitHub (pull requests, forks, branches etc).

Thanks for so interesting compilation of training materials. I really delighted when Udacity uggested looking for bugs in games. Gamification help learn faster.

Also extra material "Как учиться и справляться с негативными мыслями" created for me good atmosfere, you care about mind health of students . :)
